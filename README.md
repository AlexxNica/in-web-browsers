# IPFS In Web Browsers
> Tracking the Path to getting IPFS and other Decentralized Protocols Natively Supported in Web Browsers.

## Objectives

See the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md#the-path-to-adoption) for a breakdown of the steps we will be taking to get these protocols supported natively by web browsers.

## Current Status

Currently in order to run IPFS in a web browser, you have to either bundle js-ipfs with your client-side application or your users have to run a go-ipfs daemon on their local machines. This means we've completed the first step on [The Path to Native Browser Support](ROADMAP.md#the-path-to-native-browser-support).

The [Sprint 13-24 February](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/351) is aimed at tackling a number of the next steps.
