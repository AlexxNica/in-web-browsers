Roadmap: IPFS In Web Browsers
======

_**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** We are actively working on this Roadmap. It is subject to major changes durring the current 2-week sprint. See [ipfs/in-web-browsers#23](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/23) to track the work or comment on it._

**What we want:** Protocol handlers for decentralized web protocols, especially IPFS and IPLD, bundled natively in web browsers.

**What we need to provide to browser manufacturers:** something that demonstrates why these protocols are valuable to their users. We have to show why distributed, decentralized protocols and technologies are valuable and we need to show specifically why IPFS is valuable.

## The Path to Native Browser Support

* **Step 1.** *DONE* Implement js-ipfs  
* **Step 2.** *IN PROGRESS* Make js-ipfs and go-ipfs interoperate seamlessly (see https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/310, https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/343, https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/358)
* **Step 3.** *[IN PROGRESS](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/351)* Define the APIs, address schemes, security models, etc.
* **Step 4.** *[IN PROGRESS](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/351)* Create browsers add-ons and/or extensions that handle dweb protocols
* **Step 5.** *NEXT STEP* Make the case for IPFS & Decentralized Web Protocols in Web Browsers with Use Cases, Sample Applications, Demos and [Delightful Documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/357)
* **Step 6.** Native support in the Browsers: Protocol Handlers incorporated into the browsers by default
